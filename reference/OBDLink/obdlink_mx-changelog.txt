- CHG: Improved voltage calibration (STVCAL/ATCV commands) accuracy by sampling and averaging readings over about 500 ms
- CHG: Renamed STCAFCP/STCCFCP commands to STCFCPA/STCFCPC (old ones still available, but deprecated)
- CHG: STCSWM command now takes mode values from 0 to 8, which independently encode the high speed tool load output

- CHG: Improved CR+LF handling (ignore only the first LF after CR)
- CHG: Any fatal errors will now be printed again after a reset, to make sure they are not missed
- CHG: Improved accuracy of all timeouts from -1/+0 ms to -0/+0.5 ms precision
- CHG: Removed the possibility of device lockup, while handling a fatal error
- CHG: STSLUIT command will not accept a setting below 5 sec to prevent bricking
- CHG: Updated STDIX command output to include the new device status info
- CHG: Command cancellation via UART character is now much more responsive
- CHG: Device will no longer get stuck receiving OBD messages indefinitely during protocol detection or while handling keep-alives, if connected in parallel with another tester or if message filters are improperly configured
- CHG: Device will no longer reset the modem if the host disconnects while transmitting data
- BUG: UART inactivity sleep timer was not being reset if only CRs were being received
- BUG: UART Rx could lock up or start receiving corrupted data
- BUG: UART Tx could lock up or transmit corrupted data due to silicon erratum and race conditions
- BUG: Rarely, under very unusual conditions, UART inactivity sleep or other timeouts could get triggered prematurely
- BUG: After resetting voltage sense calibration to defaults (ATCV 0000, STVCAL), voltage-based sleep/wakeup triggers would fail to recalibrate until the next device reset
- BUG: ATCV 0000 and STVCAL commands ignored factory calibration saved via STSAVCAL until the next device reset
- BUG: STDIX command printed init month off by one
- BUG: There was a small chance of device lockup after finishing CAN message reception
- BUG: Waiting for CAN responses was not cancellable via UART character
- BUG: STSLUIT command was erroneously accepting 0 as a parameter
- BUG: Some commands that require one parameter would erroneously accept no parameters
- BUG: Protocol was not being saved after being detected via a monitoring command
- BUG: ISO 9141 protocol is now properly detected while monitoring (instead of being detected as KWP)
- BUG: There was a small chance that EEPROM would get corrupted if a device reset interrupted a specific write cycle
- BUG: CAN frame retransmissions would not stop if message transmission was canceled via a UART character
- BUG: A timeout that was too short would sometimes cause modem detection to fail



v3.1.7 - 2012/05/14
-------------------

- CHG: Disabled the short button press (enable bonding) when Bluetooth connection is active
- CHG: STRSTNVM command now also clears the Bluetooth bond table and resets the device
- CHG: Removed STTSTMXBTN command
- BUG: When resetting to factory defaults, bond table would not be cleared if the host reconnected as soon as the connection was dropped



v3.1.6 - 2012/05/11
-------------------

- NEW: STTSTMXBTN (factory use only, disable MX button functionality during assembly line testing)



v3.1.5 - 2012/05/10
-------------------
